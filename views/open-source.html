  <h2>Open Source Projects </h2>
  <p>Although most work we produce is owned by the clients we produce it for, we try to open source our work whenever possible. The intro animation on this website required development of two packages to achieve a fully responsive animation using native SVGs. A third package, Element Coordinates, was developed to provide a simple solution to the nagging problem of calculating where the various components of an element are positioned on a page. These packages are provided to the community below.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/jsneden/element-coordinates">Element Coordinates</a></h2>
  <p>Determine absolute page positioning and sizing of an element's content box (inner), padding box (background) and border box (outer). </p>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/jsneden/svg-viewbox-maximize">SVG Viewbox Maximize </a></h2>
  <p>Resize SVG viewBox coordinate system to cover container element. Also includes a utility for translating between page coordinates and SVG coordinates.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://github.com/jsneden/svg-path-transform">SVG Path Transform</a></h2>
  <p>Utilities for working with and transforming SVG Paths in the DOM.</p>
